about_drum_and_bass = Drum and bass is a genre and branch of electronic music which emerged from rave and oldschool jungle scenes in England during the early 1990s. The style is often characterized by fast breakbeats (typically between 150\u2013180 beats per minute) with heavy bass and sub-bass lines, and synthesizers. Another feature of the style is the complex syncopation of the drum tracks' breakbeat. Drum and bass subgenres include breakcore, ragga jungle, hardstep, darkstep, techstep, neurofunk, liquid funk, drumfunk, funkstep, and drill 'n' bass. From its roots in the UK, the style has established itself around the world. Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like hip hop, big beat, dubstep, house, trip hop, ambient music, techno, rock and pop.  

about_dubstep = Dubstep is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in South London, England. It emerged in the late 1990s as a development within a lineage of related styles such as 2-step garage, dub, techno, drum and bass, broken beat, jungle, and reggae. The music generally features sparse, syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies. The term \u00ABdubstep\u00BB in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by labels such as Big Apple and Tempa, by which time stylistic trends used in creating these remixes started to become more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and grime. Dubstep started to spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the Internet and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz. Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as The Wire and online publications such as Pitchfork, with a regular feature entitled The Month In: Grime/Dubstep. 

about_dyk = Matthias Paul, better known by his stage name Paul van Dyk is a German DJ, record producer and musician. One of the first true superstar DJs, Paul van Dyk was the first artist to receive a Grammy Award nomination in the newly added category of Best Dance/Electronic album for his 2003 release Reflections. He was named the World's number one DJ in both 2005 and 2006, something only few DJs have ever achieved. He was the first ever DJ to be named number one by Mixmag in 2005. By 2008, he had sold over 3 million albums worldwide. A trance producer starting in the early 1990s, in recent times, he no longer likes to describe his music as trance, but rather simply as electronic music. 

about_edm = Electronic dance music (also known as EDM, dance music, club music or simply dance) is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres produced largely for nightclubs, raves and festivals. Produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs), EDM is often used in the context of a live mix, where a DJ creates a seamless selection of tracks by segueing from one recording to the next. By the early 2010s the term \u00ABelectronic dance music\u00BB and the initialism \u00ABEDM\u00BB was being pushed by the U.S. music industry and music press in what was largely an effort to re-brand U.S. rave culture. In the UK, \u00ABdance music\u00BB or \u00ABdance\u00BB are more common terms for the genre. In this context, EDM does not refer to a specific genre, but serves as an umbrella term for several commercially popular genres, including techno, house, trance, drum and bass, dubstep, Jersey club, and their respective subgenres.

about_guetta = Pierre David Guetta is a French DJ, record producer, remixer, and songwriter. He released his first album, Just a Little More Love, in 2002. Guetta achieved mainstream success with his 2009 album One Love which included the hit singles "When Love Takes Over", "Gettin' Over You", "Sexy Bitch", and "Memories", the first three of which reached number one in the United Kingdom. He is among the first DJs to get into the EDM scene and is known as the "Grandfather of EDM". Guetta has sold over nine million albums and 30 million singles worldwide. In 2011 Guetta was voted as the number one DJ in the 'DJ Mag Top 100 DJs' fan poll. 

about_hardwell = Robbert van de Corput, who performs under the stage name Hardwell, is a Dutchhouse DJ, record producer and remixer. He was voted the World's No. 1 DJ on DJ Mag in 2013, and again in 2014. He is currently ranked at No. 3 on DJ Mag Top 100 DJs 2016 poll. Hardwell is best known for his sets at major music festivals such as Ultra Music Festival and Tomorrowland. Hardwell first gained recognition in 2009 for his bootleg of "Show Me Love vs. Be".

He has since released seven compilation albums through his label, as well as his own documentary film. His debut studio album, United We Are, was released on 23 January 2015.

about_house = House music is a genre of electronic dance music created by club DJs and music producers in Chicago in the early 1980s. Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. Nowadays house music, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent kick drum on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric deep house to the more minimalistic microhouse. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres, such as euro house, tech house, electro house and progressive house. 

about_techno = Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word techno in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built. In Detroit, techno resulted from the melding of African American music including Chicago house, funk, electro, and electric jazz. The central rhythmic component is most often in common time (4/4), where time is marked with a bass drum on each quarter note pulse, a backbeat played by snare or clap on the second and fourth pulses of the bar, and an open hi-hat sounding every second eighth note. The tempo tends to vary between approximately 120 to 150 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the style of techno. The creative use of music production technology, such as drum machines, synthesizers, and digital audio workstations, is viewed as an important aspect of the music's aesthetic. 

about_tiesto = Tijs Michiel Verwest, better known by his stage name Ti\u00EBsto, is a Dutch DJ and record producer. He is named \u00ABthe Greatest DJ of All Time\u00BB by MixMag magazine in a poll voted by the fans. In 1997, he founded the label Black Hole Recordings with Arny Bink, where he released the Magic and In Search of Sunrise CD series. His 2000 remix of Delerium's \u00ABSilence\u00BB featuring Sarah McLachlan exposed him to more mainstream audiences. In 2001, he released his first solo album, In My Memory. This album gave him several major hits that launched his career. He was voted World No. 1 DJ by DJ Magazine in its annual Top 100 DJs readership poll consecutively for three years from 2002\u201304. In April 2007 Ti\u00EBsto launched his radio show Ti\u00EBsto's Club Life on Radio 538 in the Netherlands. He won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for his remixed version of John Legend's hit \u00ABAll Of Me\u00BB at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.

about_trance = Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that developed during the 1990s in Germany. It is characterized by a tempo lying between 125 and 150 beats per minute (BPM), repeating melodic phrases, and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 \u00ABpeaks\u00BB or \u00ABdrops.\u00BB Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient, and film music. A characteristic of virtually all trance music is a mid-song climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely, and leaving the melody and/or atmospherics to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again. As a result, trance tracks are often lengthy to allow for this progression and have sufficiently sparse opening and closing sections to facilitate mixing by DJs.
